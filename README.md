## This notebook tutorial is for those who are at the intermediate level in machine learning.

In this notebook, First I have done some exploratory data analysis on the data and then Feature Engineering  . Then, I use different ensembling techniques using Bayesian Optimization to first train the model and then predict the quality of the wine.

## 1) XGBoosting Classifier
## 2) ExtraTrees Classifier
## 3) RandomForestClassifier
## 4) LGBoosting Classifier 
## 5) ExtremeGradientBoosting and RandomForest Classifier 

I have trained all the above model using Bayesian Optimization and in the end checked my model performance by ploting the learning curve
